    "\n",
    "loc (label-based indexing):\n",

    "The labels used in loc can be any valid label present in the index or column names.\n",

    "The syntax for using iloc is df.iloc[row_indexer, column_indexer].\n",
    "The row and column indexers can be single integers, lists of integers, or boolean arrays.\n",
    "When using iloc, the start index is inclusive, but the end index is exclusive.\n",
